        description: `
        Ficus Lyrata, commonly known as the fiddle-leaf fig, is a species of
        fig family Moraceae. It is native to West Africa. Fiddle leaf Fig
        grows over 15 metres tall in its natural habitat and up to 3 metres
        indoors. They can be topped to prevent them from growing taller.
        <br/><br/>
        Fiddle-leaf is a broadleaf evergreen houseplant. It has large,
        glossy, deep green violin-shaped leaves. It is ideal for growing in a
        warm, bright room, out of the glare of the direct sun. But also they
        grow well in greenhouses and conservatories because they enjoy high
        lighting conditions. It is a slow-growing plant that may take up to
        10 -15 years to reach full maturity. After 3 or 4 years of growth,
        it starts to become an attractive plant for a great focal point
        within living rooms, hallways, offices, or hotels.
