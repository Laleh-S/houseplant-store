        description: `Ficus Lyrata, commonly known as the fiddle-leaf fig, is a species of fig family Moraceae. It is native to West Africa. Fiddle leaf Fig grows over 15 metres tall in its natural habitat and up to 3 metres indoors. They can be topped to prevent them from growing taller. 
        Fiddle-leaf is a broadleaf evergreen houseplant. It has large, glossy, deep green violin-shaped leaves. It’s ideal for growing in a warm, bright room, out of the glare of the direct sun. But also they grow well in greenhouses and conservatories because they enjoy high lighting conditions. It is a slow-growing plant that may take up to 10 -15 years to reach full maturity.
